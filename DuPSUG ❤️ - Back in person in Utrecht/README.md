The Dutch PowerShell User Group is back in person for the first time in 2022!

This is an evening edition of our user group, with a special focus on Graph API, Azure DevOps, PSGallery and of course PowerShell. We will start off the event with a quick bite to eat for our attendees and speakers. We have an evening with diverse and advanced topics prepared for you presented by experienced speakers.

## Sessions

### Improve security with your own PSGallery - Leo Visser

*Leo Visser | Cloud Consultant @ OGD | https://autosysops.com/*

Did you ever make a typo when importing a PowerShell module? What if an attacker uploaded a module with that name to the PSGallery? Maybe you are using a malicious version of the Connect-AzAccount cmdlet without knowing it. To increase the security of your development environment you can create an internal artifact feed with Azure DevOps. There you can easily mirror packages from the PSGallery in a controlled manner. You can even make sure only specific versions are allowed. This would allow you to test a version before allowing it into the production environment. In this talk you will learn how to set up such a gallery and how to use it in PowerShell. You will also learn how to use this gallery to host PowerShell modules internally. So join the talk and learn how to protect your code supply chain!

### Graph API & PowerShell: where sys admins can be developers - Stephan van Rooij

Control everything you want in Microsoft 365 like all the developers do, but then with PowerShell. Microsoft created a PowerShell library for (almost) everything you can also do with the Graph API. But finding the correct cmdlets can be a challenge. And there are different ways to login, what should you use and how secure is it? Did you know, you don’t even need extra credentials or special roles to use these modules?

This talk takes you all the way. It shows you which modules you need, how you can login and how you can navigate the cmdlets you need.
