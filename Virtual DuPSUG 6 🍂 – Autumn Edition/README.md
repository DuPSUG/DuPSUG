## Speaker Information

### Graziella Iezzi
Business Applications Engineer working with third-party web applications all day long. I became fascinated with PowerShell a few years ago when I figured out that it could ease many aspects of my job. The more I use it, the more I’m motivated and curious to find out more pieces of the puzzle.

### Heiko Brenn
Heiko is PowerShell enthusiast and Product Expert at ScriptRunner – The PowerShell Management Company. He has been working in the IT industry for more than 25 years in a number of different roles like IT administrator, consultant and product manager. In his free time he is very much into music and you see (and hear!) him playing drums in the office once in a while.

## Session Information

### Some tips when your script runs in a Task Scheduler – Graziella Iezzi
Writing a script and running it from your laptop is not the same as having to run it as a task scheduled on a server. You can face more challenges, how do you trace errors, how do you store eventual credentials if you are not using PowerShell 7, how do you deploy a module?
During this talk I will share the story of how having to write a simple script ended up in writing my first module, learning what Powershell Transcript is, and how to use Clixml to store the credentials I needed.

### ScriptRunner Make PowerShell A Real Solution in 5 Steps – Heiko Brenn
Wait, isn’t PowerShell a solution already? Let me explain 🙂

We all love PowerShell because it’s an awesome framework for automating recurring tasks. Wouldn’t it be great, if you could take your code and delegate the script execution to helpdesk teams and end users in a secure and easy way? In this session I will show you how you can use ScriptRunner to simplify the way you develop, manage and delegate PowerShell scripts for Active Directory, Exchange, Office 365 and Azure in 5 steps:
1. Centralize your PowerShell scripts, including Git sync
2. Secure credentials and permissions management, including password server support
3. Automatically create a web GUI from Synopsis information and parameters
4. Monitor all PowerShell activities with a flexible dashboard
5. Delegate script execution to helpdesk teams and end users
