## Session Information

### Some tips when your script runs in a Task Scheduler ‚Äì Graziella Iezzi
Writing a script and running it from your laptop is not the same as having to run it as a task scheduled on a server. You can face more challenges, how do you trace errors, how do you store eventual credentials if you are not using PowerShell 7, how do you deploy a module?
During this talk I will share the story of how having to write a simple script ended up in writing my first module, learning what Powershell Transcript is, and how to use Clixml to store the credentials I needed.

### ScriptRunner Make PowerShell A Real Solution in 5 Steps ‚Äì Heiko Brenn
Wait, isn‚Äôt PowerShell a solution already? Let me explain üôÇ

We all love PowerShell because it‚Äôs an awesome framework for automating recurring tasks. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great, if you could take your code and delegate the script execution to helpdesk teams and end users in a secure and easy way? In this session I will show you how you can use ScriptRunner to simplify the way you develop, manage and delegate PowerShell scripts for Active Directory, Exchange, Office 365 and Azure in 5 steps:
1. Centralize your PowerShell scripts, including Git sync
2. Secure credentials and permissions management, including password server support
3. Automatically create a web GUI from Synopsis information and parameters
4. Monitor all PowerShell activities with a flexible dashboard
5. Delegate script execution to helpdesk teams and end users
